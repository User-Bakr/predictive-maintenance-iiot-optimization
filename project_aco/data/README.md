# Dataset Information

This project uses two separate datasets obtained from **Kaggle**, corresponding
to the binary and multi-class predictive maintenance tasks described in the paper.

The datasets are not included in this repository due to licensing and size
considerations.

## 1. Binary Classification Dataset

**Purpose:**  
Used for binary predictive maintenance experiments (normal vs faulty).

**Task Type:**  
Binary classification

**Target Variable:**  
Binary fault label (e.g., normal / fault)

**Source:**  
Kaggle (public dataset)

**Notes:**  
- Dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize features.
- Class imbalance handling (if any) is described in the associated paper.

## 2. Multi-Class Classification Dataset

**Purpose:**  
Used for multi-class predictive maintenance experiments involving multiple fault types.

**Task Type:**  
Multi-class classification

**Target Variable:**  
Multiple fault categories

**Source:**  
Kaggle (public dataset)

**Notes:**  
- Dataset contains multiple fault classes representing different system failures.
- Feature preprocessing and class definitions follow the methodology described in the paper.
