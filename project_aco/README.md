# Project 2: An Enhanced Ant Colony Optimization Approach for Multi-Classifier Predictive Maintenance in Industrial IoT Systems

## Overview
This project implements the experimental framework for the research work entitled  
**“An Enhanced Ant Colony Optimization Approach for Multi-Classifier Predictive Maintenance in Industrial IoT Systems.”**

The study focuses on improving predictive maintenance performance in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems by integrating **multiple machine learning classifiers** with an **enhanced Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** strategy.

---

## Methodology Summary
The proposed framework evaluates both **binary** and **multi-class** predictive maintenance scenarios using multiple classifiers and an optimization-based selection strategy.

### Machine Learning Models
- **Binary classification**
  - Logistic Regression (LR)
  - Decision Tree (DT)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- **Multi-class classification**
  - Decision Tree (DT)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Optimization Strategy
- An **Enhanced Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** algorithm is used to:
  - Select suitable classifiers
  - Optimize model parameters
  - Improve fault detection robustness and generalization

## Code Availability Notice
The full implementation of the **Enhanced Ant Colony Optimization** algorithm and
paper-specific heuristics is **not publicly available** due to publication access
restrictions.

This repository provides:
- A structured outline of the implementation
- The experimental pipeline design
- Clear documentation of the models and optimization strategy used

Detailed algorithmic descriptions, configurations, and experimental results are
available in the associated research paper.
