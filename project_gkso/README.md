# Project 1: GKSO-based Predictive Maintenance

This project implements the methodology described in:

**Optimizing Predictive Maintenance in Industrial IoT using Enhanced Genghis Khan Shark Optimizer**

## Description
The project focuses on predictive maintenance using **Logistic Regression** optimized through an **Enhanced Genghis Khan Shark Optimizer (GKSO)**.

The goal is to improve fault prediction accuracy and maintenance decision quality in Industrial IoT environments.

## Structure
- `data/` – datasets or data loaders
- `preprocessing/` – data preprocessing and feature engineering
- `models/` – machine learning models (Logistic Regression)
- `optimization/` – GKSO implementation
- `experiments/` – experiment scripts
- `results/` – logs and evaluation results
