## Research Projects

### 1. Optimizing Predictive Maintenance in Industrial IoT using Enhanced Genghis Khan Shark Optimizer
This project focuses on improving predictive maintenance performance in IIoT systems by optimizing machine learning–based fault prediction using an enhanced metaheuristic approach.

**Key aspects:**
- Predictive maintenance modeling using **Logistic Regression**
- Proposal of an **Enhanced Genghis Khan Shark Optimizer (GKSO)** to optimize model parameters and maintenance decision variables
- Improved fault prediction accuracy and optimization efficiency
- Fog computing–oriented design for low-latency and distributed industrial environments

The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline optimization techniques.
